# Photo Dedup Tool - Risk Assessment

## Architectural Risk Analysis

### Chosen Architecture: Hybrid Web App + Python Backend
**Risk Level: MEDIUM-HIGH** - Complex but manageable for non-professional developer

### Alternative Architecture Comparison

#### 1. Pure Native Desktop App (tkinter/PyQt)
**Pros:**
- Single technology stack to learn
- No web server complexity
- Simpler deployment (one executable)
- Better for non-developer (familiar desktop patterns)

**Cons:**
- Photo gallery UI will be poor quality
- Complex image layout and selection logic
- Limited responsive design capabilities
- Harder to create attractive interface

**Risk Assessment:** LOWER complexity but POOR user experience

#### 2. Pure Web App (no local backend)
**Pros:**
- Best UI capabilities
- Familiar web development patterns
- Rich photo gallery libraries available

**Cons:**
- CANNOT access macOS Photos library
- Requires manual photo export/import
- No smart album creation capability
- Defeats core project purpose

**Risk Assessment:** IMPOSSIBLE - doesn't meet requirements

#### 3. Chosen: Hybrid Web + Python Backend
**Pros:**
- Best UI for photo comparison
- Meets all functional requirements
- Separates concerns cleanly
- Web UI skills transferable

**Cons:**
- Two technology stacks to learn
- Local server complexity
- More potential failure points
- Deployment complexity

## Technical Risk Assessment

### HIGH RISK - Development Complexity
**Issue:** Non-professional developer managing two codebases (Python + Web)
**Impact:** Project abandonment, extended timeline, poor code quality
**Likelihood:** HIGH

**Derisking Strategies:**
1. Start with minimal web UI (basic HTML forms)
2. Get Python backend working first with simple CLI
3. Use Flask (simpler than FastAPI) for backend
4. Avoid JavaScript frameworks - use vanilla JS
5. Focus on functionality over aesthetics initially

### HIGH RISK - macOS Photos Library Access
**Issue:** `osxphotos` library may have permissions/compatibility issues
**Impact:** Core functionality broken, need architecture change
**Likelihood:** MEDIUM

**Derisking Strategies:**
1. **PRIORITY 1:** Test `osxphotos` installation and basic library access FIRST
2. Create minimal test script before building full application
3. Research macOS permissions requirements
4. Have fallback plan for manual photo export workflow

### MEDIUM RISK - Image Processing Performance
**Issue:** Large photo libraries may cause memory/performance issues
**Impact:** App unusable for intended use case, user frustration
**Likelihood:** MEDIUM

**Derisking Strategies:**
1. Implement pagination/batching from start
2. Test with progressively larger photo sets
3. Use lazy loading and caching strategies
4. Profile memory usage during development

### MEDIUM RISK - Web Server Security
**Issue:** Local Flask server exposed to network, potential security vulnerabilities
**Impact:** Security compromise, malware risk
**Likelihood:** LOW-MEDIUM

**Derisking Strategies:**
1. Bind server to localhost only (127.0.0.1)
2. Use random port assignment
3. No external network access required
4. Keep dependencies minimal and updated

### MEDIUM RISK - Distribution/Installation
**Issue:** No App Store access, complex installation for end users
**Impact:** Tool only works for developer, sharing impossible
**Likelihood:** HIGH if sharing intended

**Derisking Strategies:**
1. Focus on personal use first
2. Document installation steps clearly
3. Consider PyInstaller for executable creation later
4. Use virtual environments to manage dependencies

### LOW RISK - Data Format Changes
**Issue:** macOS Photos library format changes break compatibility
**Impact:** Tool stops working after macOS updates
**Likelihood:** LOW

**Derisking Strategies:**
1. Use well-maintained `osxphotos` library
2. Test with multiple macOS versions if possible
3. Keep dependencies updated

## Project Success Risks

### HIGH RISK - Scope Creep
**Issue:** Adding features before core functionality works
**Impact:** Never-finishing project, complexity explosion
**Likelihood:** HIGH for non-professional developer

**Derisking Strategies:**
1. **STRICT adherence to Phase 1 only**
2. Resist feature additions until core works
3. Document future features but don't implement
4. Focus on minimal viable product

### MEDIUM RISK - Learning Curve Overwhelm
**Issue:** Too many new technologies at once (Flask, HTML/CSS/JS, image processing)
**Impact:** Developer burnout, project abandonment
**Likelihood:** MEDIUM

**Derisking Strategies:**
1. Use familiar technologies where possible
2. Extensive use of tutorials and documentation
3. Build incrementally with working checkpoints
4. Accept imperfect initial implementations

## Recommended Development Priority Order (High Risk First)

1. **CRITICAL:** Test `osxphotos` library access - create simple script to list photos
2. **HIGH:** Build minimal Python backend with basic photo scanning
3. **HIGH:** Create simple HTML page to display photo data (no images yet)
4. **MEDIUM:** Add actual image display to web frontend
5. **MEDIUM:** Implement photo grouping logic
6. **LOW:** Add selection UI and smart album creation

## Success Metrics & Early Warning Signs

**Green Flags:**
- `osxphotos` successfully lists photos within first day
- Simple Flask server serves basic HTML within first week
- Photo groups display correctly within first month

**Red Flags (Consider Architecture Change):**
- Cannot access Photos library after multiple attempts
- Web interface too complex to implement
- Performance unacceptable with moderate photo sets (>1000 photos)

## Fallback Architecture Plan

If hybrid approach proves too complex:
**Fallback:** Pure Python CLI tool with simple text-based photo selection
- Generates lists of similar photos
- User manually reviews and deletes in Photos app
- Much simpler but less user-friendly
