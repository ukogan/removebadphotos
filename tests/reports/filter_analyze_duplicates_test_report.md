### Test 6: Console Error Detection

**Status:** ❌ FAILED (Non-Critical Errors)  
**Browsers:** Chrome, Firefox, Safari

**JavaScript Errors Found:**
1. `TypeError: Failed to fetch` during library stats loading
2. `Error loading initial analysis: TypeError: Failed to fetch`

**Analysis:** These appear to be race condition errors during initial page load when some API endpoints aren't immediately available. The errors don't prevent core functionality from working.

### Test 7: UI Response Time Performance

**Status:** ✅ PASSED (Chrome), ❌ FAILED (Firefox timeout)  
**Performance Results (Chrome):**
- Filter application: 125ms (excellent)
- Analyze button response: 40ms (excellent)
- Both well under performance thresholds

## Server Performance Analysis

**Backend Processing is Highly Efficient:**
- Photo library scan: ~9.5 seconds for 14,226 photos
- Filter operations: 0.00s - 0.02s per filter
- Analysis completion: 0.0s - 0.1s per analysis
- API response times: Sub-100ms for most operations

**Filter Processing Examples:**
```
🔍 Cluster filtering requested with: {'year': 2024}
📅 Year 2024 filter: 689 clusters remain
✅ LazyPhotoLoader: Filtering completed in 0.00s
📊 Filtered: 2405 → 689 clusters
```

## API Endpoint Health

**Working Correctly:**
- `/api/analyze-duplicates` - ✅ Core functionality works
- `/api/filter-clusters` - ✅ Filter application successful
- `/api/filter-distributions` - ✅ Statistics loading functional

**Server Response Pattern:**
```
POST /api/analyze-duplicates HTTP/1.1" 200
GET /legacy HTTP/1.1" 200
```
